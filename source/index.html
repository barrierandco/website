      <h3>Communication</h3>
      <p>How many times have you hired someone, then they just disappear? We like to stay in touch, no matter how much work is going on. With us, you get a personal email from someone on the team at least once a week.</p>

      <h3>Easy Access</h3>
      <p>During a typical project, dozens of emails, images and other items emails sent back and forth. To make things less hectic during a project, we create a single webpage for each client with all assets within one click’s reach. </p>
